        <p>On August 19, 2024, I attended the CCS Opening Devotion, organized by the College of Computer Studies (CCS), from 7:30 to 9 AM. This activity marked the beginning of the academic year with a spiritual gathering to reflect, pray, and seek guidance for the months ahead. As a participant, I joined the worship session, listened to the speaker’s message, and reflected on the values shared during the devotion.</p>
        <br/><p>I was able to concentrate myself and get ready for the challenges of the school year both spiritually and mentally thanks to this activity. The speaker's message of faith and resilience inspired me and gave me a sense of purpose and optimism. The group prayer, where everyone joined together in harmony, was the most significant aspect. It served as a reminder to me of the value of building a solid foundation first. </p>
        <br/><p>This experience encouraged me to make time for moments of reflection and prayer, even amidst a busy schedule. I want to attend more devotions like this to stay grounded and motivated throughout the year. If I could participate again, I’d focus on sharing my thoughts during the open reflection to engage more deeply.</p>
        <br/><p>Because of this activity, I am more grounded in my faith and ready to face the challenges of the academic year with a positive mindset. I feel inspired to incorporate regular spiritual practices into my life to maintain balance and peace. This event also reminded me of the strength that comes from being part of a supportive community.</p>
