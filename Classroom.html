        <h1>Guidance Counseling Group Dynamics Activity</h1> <br>
        <p>On August 19, 2024, I attended the Guidance Counseling Group Dynamics Activity, organized by CCS, from 10 AM to 12 PM. This session focused on helping students build stronger connections with their peers through group exercises and open discussions. As a participant, I joined activities that encouraged teamwork, communication, and self-reflection. The goal was to foster a sense of belonging and emotional growth within our department.<br/><br/>
        This activity gave me a deeper understanding of how important communication and empathy are in building relationships. I was surprised by how open and supportive everyone was during the discussions, which made the environment comfortable and encouraging. The best part was realizing that we all face similar challenges, and sharing these experiences brought us closer as a group. It taught me that understanding others helps in creating meaningful connections.<br/><br/>
        This experience motivated me to be more proactive in reaching out to classmates and building stronger relationships. I also want to apply the teamwork and communication skills I learned to future group projects. If I could join again, I’d participate even more actively and share more about my thoughts to contribute to the discussions.<br/><br/>
        Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of emotional intelligence and teamwork. I feel more connected to my peers and motivated to nurture meaningful friendships. This event reminded me of how much we can achieve when we understand and support one another.</p>

        <p> On August 20, 2024, I attended the Balik Talent Lecture titled "Big Data and IoT: Why They Matter in Innovation", organized by CCS, from 8:30 to 11 AM. This lecture was delivered by an alumnus of our department, who shared insights into how Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) are shaping the future. As a participant and part of the working committee, I listened to the discussion, took pictures during the lecture, and learned about the practical applications of these technologies in various industries.<br/><br/>
            My grasp of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data and their critical role in fostering innovation has expanded as a result of this lecture. The shared real-world examples, which demonstrated how these tools enhance productivity and decision-making, astounded me. Finding out how IoT devices may gather data to address issues we encounter on a daily basis was the most unexpected aspect. It helped me understand how crucial it is to keep up with new developments in technology. <br/><br/>
            This lecture inspired me to explore Big Data and IoT further, especially how they relate to my studies. I plan to look into certifications or projects that involve these technologies to deepen my knowledge. If I could attend a similar event, I’d prepare questions to ask the speaker and take more notes to fully capture the key points.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more curious about the role of technology in shaping our world.

        <h1>Movie Night Day 2</h1> <br>
        <p>On August 21, 2024, I attended Movie Night Day 2, organized by CCS, from 5 to 7 PM. The featured movie was "Inside Out 2", a sequel to the beloved animated film exploring emotions and relationships. As a participant, I watched the movie with my peers and reflected on its themes of personal growth and self-awareness. The activity aimed to provide entertainment while sparking meaningful discussions.<br/><br/>
            This film got me thinking about how important it is to comprehend emotions and how they affect our relationships.

Seeing it with friends enhanced the experience and added significance, so that was the best part. It served as a reminder to me of the significance of recognizing and processing my emotions. <br/><br/>
            I was motivated by this experience to see more movies that teach important life lessons.
